### Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be Merciful!

* __Surah Al-Anam 6/54__: [Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be Merciful!](https://quran.com/6/54)

## Three primary types of Nafs (Self): 
1. Nafs al-Ammara (the Commanding Self)
2. Nafs al-Lawwama (the Reproaching Self)
3. Nafs al-Mutma'inna (the Content Self)

* __Surah Yusuf 12/53 (${\color{red}Nafs ~al-Ammara}$)__: [And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”](https://quran.com/12/53)

* __Surah Al-Qiyamah 75/2 (${\color{red}Nafs ~al-Lawwama}$)__: [And I do swear by the self-reproaching soul!](https://quran.com/75/2)

* __Surah Al-Fajr 89/27-30 (${\color{red}Nafs ~al-Mutmainna}$)__: [˹Allah will say to the righteous,˺ “O tranquil soul! Return to your Lord, well pleased ˹with Him˺ and well pleasing ˹to Him˺. So join My servants, and enter My Paradise.”](https://quran.com/89/27-30)

### Tazkia Nafas

* __Surah Shamas 91/7-9__: [And by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it. then with ˹the knowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it! Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul.](https://quran.com/91/7-9)

### Every Nafas is Pledged

* __Surah Al-Muddaththir 74/38-48__: [Every soul will be detained for what it has done,](https://quran.com/74/38-48)
