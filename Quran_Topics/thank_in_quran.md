*** 

* __Surah An-Naml [Ant] 27/19 (King Solomon...Thankfulness)__: [So Solomon smiled in amusement at her words, and prayed, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You have blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please you. Admit me, by Your mercy, into ˹the company of˺ Your righteous servants.”](https://quranwbw.com/27/19)
