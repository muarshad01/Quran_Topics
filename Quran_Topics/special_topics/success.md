* __Surah Al A’ala (87:14)__:

He/she has certainly succeeded who purifies himself/herself.

* __Surah Ash Shams (91:9)__:

Indeed he/she succeeds who purifies his/her ownself.

* __Surah Al Buruj (85:11)__:

Indeed, those who believe [(Have faith (1)in Allah, as He is, with all His names and attributes and acceptance of all His commands; (2)in His Angels, (3) His books, (4) all His Messengers, (5) the day of Judgement, (6) in that the fate good and bad is predetermined by Allah and (7) in the coming to life after death (resurrection)] and do righteous good deeds, for them will be (in the life to come) Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). That is the great success.

* __Surah Al Araf (7:8)__:

And the weighing (of deeds) on that day (Day of Judgement) will be the true/just (weighing). So as for those whose scale (of good deeds) will be heavy, they will be the successful ones (by entering Paradise).  

* __Surah Al Araf (7:69)__:

“Do you wonder that there has come to you a Reminder (and an advice) from your Lord through a man from amongst you that he may warn you? And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh (Noah), and increased you amply in stature. So remember the graces (bestowed upon you) from Allah, so that you may be successful.”  

* __Surah Al Araf (7:157)__:

Those who follow the Messenger, the (Ummi/unlettered) Prophet, who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad ﷺ) whom they find mentioned in the Taurat /Torah (Deut, xviii, 15) and the Injeel/Gospel (John xiv, 16), – he commands them what is just/right (Al-Ma’ruf); and forbids them what is evil/wrong (Al-Munkar); he allows them as lawful At-Taiyibat [(i.e. all good and pure) as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.], and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khaba’ith (i.e. all evil and impure as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad ﷺ), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.  

* __Surah Al Qasas (28:67)__:

But as for him/her who repented (from disbelief, polytheism, sins, etc.), believed (in the Oneness of Allah, and in His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ), and did righteous deeds (in the life of this world), then he/she will be among those who are successful.  

* __Surah Yunus (10:63-64)__:

Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah), and used to fear Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). (10:63) They shall have good news in this world’s life and in the hereafter. The words of Allah do not change. This is indeed the supreme success. (10:64)  

* __Surah Yusuf (12:23)__:

And she, in whose house he [Yusuf (pease be upon him)] was, sought to seduce him (to do an evil act), she closed the doors and said: “Come on, O you.” He said: “I seek refuge in Allah (or Allah forbid)! Truly, he (your husband) is my master! He made my stay agreeable! (So I will never betray him). Indeed, the Zalimun (wrong and evil-doers) will never be successful.”  

* __Surah Al Anam (6:16)__:

One who will be saved from the torment on the Day of Judgment will certainly have received Allah’s mercy and this will be a manifest/obvious success/triumph.  

* __Surah As Saffat (37:60)__:

Truly, this is the supreme success! (Please read from Verses 40 to 60 that describe life in heaven, to get a correct understanding and background of this Verse).  

* __Surah Luqman (31:2-5)__:

These are Verses of the Wise Book (the Quran). (31:2) A guidance and mercy for the doers of good. (31:3) Those who establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity, and have (in their hearts) the assurance/faith of the Hereafter. (31:4) These are on (true) guidance from their Lord: and these are the ones who are successful. (31:5)  

* __Surah Az Zumar (39:61)__:

And Allah will deliver those who feared Him (the pious, righteous, virtuous) to their places of success (Paradise). Evil shall touch them not, nor shall they grieve.  

* __Surah Ghafer/Momin (40:9)__:

And protect them from the evil consequences (of their deeds). And he/she whom You protect from evil consequences on that Day ( Day of Judgement) – You will have given him/her mercy. And that is the supreme success. (These are the invocations for believers made by the Angels bearing the Throne of Allah).  

* __Surah Ad Dukhan (44:51-57)__:

Indeed, the righteous will be in a place of Security (Paradise); (44:51) Among Gardens and Springs; (44:52) Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade, they will face each other; (44:53) So (it will be), and We shall marry them with companions pure, most beautiful of eye. (44:54) They will be offered all kinds of fruits, in peace and security. (44:55) They will not taste death therein except the first death (of this world which they have already been through), and He will have protected them from the punishment of Hellfire. (44:56) As a Bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme success! (44:57)  

* __Surah Al Jathiya (45:30)__:

Then, as for those who believed and did righteous good deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy. That will be the evident success.  

* __Surah Al Muminoon (23:1-11)__:

Successful indeed are the believers. (23:1) Those who offer their prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (23:2) And those who turn away from all that is frivolous (dirty, false, evil, vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allah has forbidden). (23:3) Who are intent on inner purity / who are active in deeds of charity (pay Zakat) (both meanings are intended, purification of the soul as well as wealth). (23:4) And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) (23:5) (not giving way to their desires) with any but their spouses – that is, those whom they rightfully possess (through wedlock): for then, behold, they are free of all blame, (23:6) But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that exceed the limits (are transgressors/aggressors) (23:7) Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants; (23:8) And those who strictly guard their prayers (i.e. they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times). (23:9) These are indeed the inheritors. (23:10) Who shall inherit the Firdaus (the highest part of Paradise). They shall dwell therein forever. (23:11)  

* __Surah Al Muminoon (23:102)__:

And those whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy – it is they who are the successful.  

* __Surah Al Muminoon (23:109-111)__:

Indeed ! There was a party of My slaves, who used to say: “Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of all who show mercy!” (23:109) But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them. (23:110) Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient endurance – they are indeed the ones that are successful. (23:111)  

* __Surah An Naba (78:31-36)__:

Indeed, for the righteous, there will be a success (Paradise); (78:31) They will have gardens and vineyards, (78:32) and beautiful / handsome companions / spouses well-matched, (78:33) and a continuously filled cup (of happiness/ pure vine) overflowing. (78:34) They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying. (People of Paradise will remain secure against idle, false and indecent talk, gossiping, lying, any use of abusive language, slandering; calumnies and false accusations which are so common in the world.) (78:35) Recompense from thy Lord, a gift, (amply) sufficient. (i.e. not merely in accordance with their good deeds but far in excess of them, in accordance with Allah’s unlimited bounty.) (78:36)  

* __Surah Ar Rum (30:38)__:

So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveller. That is best for those who desire the countenance of Allah, and it is they who will be the successful.  

* __Surah Al Baqarah (2:2-5)__

This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah – (2:2) who believe in (the existence of) that which is beyond the reach of human perception, and are constant in prayer, and spend on others out of what We provide for them as sustenance; (2:3) and who believe in that which has been bestowed from on high upon thee, (O Muhammad ﷺ) as well as in that which was bestowed before you : for it is they who in their innermost are certain of the life to come! (2:4) It is they who follow the guidance (which comes) from their Sustainer; and it is they who shall attain success! (2:5)  

* __Surah Al Baqarah (2:189)__

(O Muhammad ﷺ), they ask you about the different phases of the moon. Tell them that they are there to indicate to people the phases of time and the pilgrimage season. It is not a righteous act to enter houses from the back. Righteousness is to be pious and enter the houses from the front door and fear Allah that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Anfal (8:45)__

O you who believe! When you meet (an enemy) force, take a firm stand against them and remember Allah much (both with tongue and mind), so that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Imran (3:104)__

And let there be (arising) from you a nation inviting to (all that is) good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful.  

* __Surah Al Imran (3:130)__

O you who have believed, do not consume usury (interest), doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Imran (3:185)__

Every soul will taste death. And only on the Day of Judgement /Resurrection shall you be paid your reward/recompense in full (for whatever you have done). And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he/she indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing).  

* __Surah Al Imran (3:200)__

O you who believe! Be patient in adversity, and vie in patience with one another, and be ever ready (to do what is right), and remain conscious of Allah, so that you may be successful!  

* __Surah Al Ahzab (33:70-71)__

O you who believe! Remain conscious of Allah, and (always) speak with a will to bring out (only) what is just and true (33:70) He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ), he/she has indeed achieved a great success (i.e. he/she will be saved from the Hell-fire and made to enter Paradise). (33:71)  

* __Surah An Nisa (4:13)__

These are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide eternally therein, and that will be the great success.  

* __Surah Al Hadid (57:12)__

On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right, (it will be said), “Your good tidings today are (of) gardens beneath which rivers flow (Paradise), wherein you will abide eternally.” Truly, this is the great success!  

* __Surah Al Hashr (59:9)__

Those who were already firmly established in their homes (in Medina), and firmly rooted in faith, show love for those who migrated to them (from Makkah) for refuge and harbour no desire in their hearts for what has been given to them. They give them preference over themselves, even though they themselves are poor: those who are saved from their own souls’ greed are truly successful.  

* __Surah Al Hashr (59:20)__

Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise. The companions of Paradise – they are the attainers (of success).  

* __Surah An Nur (24:31)__

And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband’s fathers, their sons, their husbands’ sons, their brothers or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their women, or the slaves, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.  

* __Surah An Nur (24:51)__

The response of the believers, when they are invited to Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ) that He may judge between them, is only to say, “We hear and we obey” and these it is that are the successful.  

* __Surah An Nur (24:52)__

And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ), fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful ones.  


* __Surah Al Hajj (22:77)__

O you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Mujadilah (58:22)__

You (O Muhammad ﷺ) will not find people who (truly) believe in Allah and the Last Day loving/befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad ﷺ) – even though they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or (others of) their kindred. (As for the true believers,) it is they in whose hearts He has inscribed faith, and whom He has strengthened with inspiration/guidance from Himself, and whom (in time) He will admit into gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide. Allah is well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Indeed, it is the Party of Allah that will be successful.  

* __Surah At Taghabun (64:9)__

(Think of the time) when He will assemble you (all) for the Day of Assembly – that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain (i.e. loss for the disbelievers as they will enter the Hell-fire and gain for the believers as they will enter Paradise). And those who believe in Allah and perform righteous good deeds – He will forgive them their sin/misdeeds and admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever (beyond the count of time). That will be the great success.  

* __Surah At Taghabun (64:16)__

So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can; listen and obey; and spend in charity for the benefit of your own soul (that is better for yourselves). And whosoever is saved from his/her own covetousness (the stinginess/greediness of the soul), then they are the successful ones.  

* __Surah As Saff (61:10-11-12)__:

O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment? (61:10)  (It is that) you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. (61:11) (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of eternal bliss (Paradise), that is indeed the great success. (61:12)  

* __Surah Al Jumuah (62:9-10)__

O you who have believed, when the call for the prayer is made on the day of Jumu’ah (Friday), then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave all worldly commerce/trade. That is best for you, if you only knew. (62:9) And when the prayer has been concluded, disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allah, and remember Allah much that you may succeed. (62:10)  

* __Surah Al Fat’h (48:5)__

O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. Seek the means of nearness to Him, and strive hard in His Cause as much as you can. So that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Maidah (5:90)__

O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, (sacrificing on) stone alters (to other than Allah), and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Maidah (5:100)__:

Say, “Not equal are the evil and the good (as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), although the abundance of evil might impress you.” So fear Allah, O you of understanding, that you may be successful.  

* __Surah Al Maidah (5:119)__

Allah will say, “This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” For them are gardens (in Paradise) beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, Allah being pleased with them, and they with Him. That is the great success.  

* __Surah At Taubah/Baraatun (9:20)__

The ones who have believed, emigrated and striven in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are highest in rank in the sight of Allah. And it is those who are the attainers (of success).  

* __Surah At Taubah/Baraatun (9:72)__

Allah has promised to the believers -men and women, – Gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein forever, and beautiful mansions in Gardens of ‘Adn (Eden Paradise). But the greatest bliss is the Good Pleasure of Allah. That is the supreme success.  


* __Surah At Taubah/Baraatun (9:88-89)__

But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives (in Allah’s Cause). Such are they for whom are the good things. Such are they who are the successful. (9:88) Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the supreme success. (9:89)  

* __Surah At Taubah/Baraatun (9:100)__

The vanguard (of Islam)- the Muhajirun (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid, the Ansar (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the Muhajirun), and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds,- well-pleased is Allah with them, as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.  

* __Surah At-Taubah/Baraatun (9:111)__

Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties (in exchange) for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. (It is) a true promise (binding) upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. That is the supreme success.
