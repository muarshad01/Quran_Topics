#### Ransom
* __Surah Ar-Raad 13/18__: [Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest!](https://quran.com/13/18)

#### Wish
