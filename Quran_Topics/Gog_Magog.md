## Gog and Magog
* __Surah Kahf 18/99__: [On that Day, We will let them surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather all ˹people˺ together.](https://quranwbw.com/18/99)
   * Until ˹after˺ Gog and Magog have broken loose ˹from the barrier˺, swarming down from every hill

* __Surah Al-Anbya 21/96-97 (Gog and Magog)__: [(96) until ˹after˺ Gog and Magog have broken loose ˹from the barrier˺,1 swarming down from every hill, (97) ushering in the True Promise.1 Then—behold!—the disbelievers will stare ˹in horror, crying,˺ “Oh, woe to us! We have truly been heedless of this. In fact, we have been wrongdoers.”](https://quran.com/21/96-97)
