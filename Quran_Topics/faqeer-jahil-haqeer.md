## Faqeer, Haqeer, Jahil

#### Jahil
* __Surah Ahzab 33/72 (Jahil)__: [Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they ˹all˺ declined to bear it, being fearful of it. But humanity assumed it, ˹for˺ they are truly wrongful ˹to themselves˺ and ignorant ˹of the consequences˺,](https://quranwbw.com/33/72)

#### Faqeer (The Word `Naas`)
* __Surah Faatir 35/15 (Faqeer)__: [O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.](https://quranwbw.com/35/15)
* __Surah Muhammad 47/38__: [Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of Allah. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you ˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you.
](https://quranwbw.com/47/38)
