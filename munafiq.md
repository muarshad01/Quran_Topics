* The chief of the hypocrites, __Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul__, the enemy of the Prophet. Abdullah bin Ubayy's full name is Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, after his mother.
* __Surah At-Tawba__: [˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people.](https://quranwbw.com/9/80)
* __Surah At-Tawba__: [And do not ever offer ˹funeral˺ prayers for any of their dead, nor stand by their grave ˹at burial˺, for they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger and died rebellious.](https://quranwbw.com/9/84)
