## Rehmat

* __Surah Al-Baqarah 2/64__: [Yet you turned away afterwards. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, you would have certainly been of the losers.](https://quranwbw.com/2/64)
* __Surah Al-Baqarah 2/105__: [The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists would not want you to receive any blessing from your Lord, but Allah selects whoever He wills for His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.](https://quranwbw.com/2/105)

This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment.](https://quranwbw.com/2/178)

* __Surah Al-Baqarah 2/286__: [Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/286)
