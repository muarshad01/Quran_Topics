### [Dream Signs You Must Know | SSA Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZjCe02IDFo)
* Three Types:
1. Sachay - Tabeer is exactly like what we see
2. We need Tabeer - Only that person can tell who has ilm-e-tabeer
3. Thired type is based on our Waswasa or our Nafs is showing us
* Never tell your dream after 2:00 pm in the afternoon. Otherwise, it is wasted!
* What is your spiritual condition
* What part of night have you seen that dream
* Right after sleeping...digestion systems
  * Third part of night - Tahajjat; our own sauch / mind / thinking
  * Right Before / After the Fajr prayer
