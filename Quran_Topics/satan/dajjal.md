The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earthquakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the non-believers and the hypocrites from it."

Ibn Sayyad (Saf ibn Sayyad) was a figure during Prophet Muhammad's time suspected by some companions, including Umar, and even the Prophet himself, to be the Dajjal (False Messiah) due to some matching characteristics, but later Islamic tradition distinguishes him as a soothsayer or charlatan, not the ultimate Dajjal, whose identity was clarified later by narratives like Tamim al-Dari's encounter, revealing the true Dajjal's distinct features like being childless and unable to enter Mecca
