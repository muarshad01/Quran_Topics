* __2/69__: [They said, “Call upon your Lord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a bright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’”](https://quranwbw.com/2/69) 

* __2/70__: [Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/70) 

* __2/71__: [He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly!](https://quranwbw.com/2/71) 

* __2/72__: [˹This is˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah revealed what you concealed.
](https://quranwbw.com/2/72)

](https://quranwbw.com/2/73)

***

* __2/75__: [Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it?](https://quranwbw.com/2/75) 

* __2/83__: [And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel ˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.](https://quranwbw.com/2/83) 

* __2/84__: [And ˹remember˺ when We took your covenant that you would neither shed each other’s blood nor expel each other from their homes, you gave your pledge and bore witness.](https://quranwbw.com/2/84) 

* __2/85__: [But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you.1 Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.](https://quranwbw.com/2/85) 

* __2/92__: [Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.](https://quranwbw.com/2/92) 

* __2/93__: [And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!”](https://quranwbw.com/2/93) 

* __2/94 (Ask them to Wish for Death)__: [Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively for you ˹Israelites˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death if what you say is true!”](https://quranwbw.com/2/94) 

* __2/95 (They'll never Wish for Death)__: [But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done.1 And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.](https://quranwbw.com/2/95) 

* __2/96 (Wish to live 1,000 years)__: [You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.](https://quranwbw.com/2/96) 

* __2/111 (claim only Jews and Christins with enter Paradise)__: [The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/111)
  
* __2/122__: [O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others.](https://quranwbw.com/2/122)

* __2/243 (Die!!! Which Incident is this???)__: [Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who fled their homes in the thousands for fear of death? Allah said to them, “Die!” then He gave them life. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful.](https://quranwbw.com/2/243)

***

## Surah An-Nisaa

### Wanted to See Allah SWT
* __4/153 (Bring us in Writing from Allah SWT)__: [The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven. They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

* __4/154 (Raised Mountain )__: [We raised the Mount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said, “Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

* __4/155 (Kill the Prophets)__: [˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few—](https://quranwbw.com/4/154)

* __4/156__: [and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary,](https://quranwbw.com/4/155)

And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”](https://quranwbw.com/5/12)

* __Surah 5/13 (Always find deceit on their part)__: [But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ˹O Prophet˺ will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.](https://quranwbw.com/5/13)

#### Killed Prophets
* __5/70__: [Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not desire, they denied some and killed others.](https://quranwbw.com/5/70)

* __5/71__: [They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.](https://quranwbw.com/5/71)

* __5/80 (They've earned Allah’s Wrath!)__: [You see many of them taking the disbelievers as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have earned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment.](https://quranwbw.com/5/80)

* __5/81 (They take Pagans as Allies)__: [Had they believed in Allah, the Prophet, and what has been revealed to him, they would have never taken those ˹pagans˺ as allies. But most of them are rebellious.](https://quranwbw.com/5/81)

***

## Al Araaf (The Heights)

* __7/163 (Sabbath)__: [Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.1 During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.](https://quranwbw.com/7/163)

* __7/164__: [When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”](https://quranwbw.com/7/164)

* __7/168__: [We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.
](https://quranwbw.com/7/168)

* __7/169__: [Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?
](https://quranwbw.com/7/169)

* __7/170__: [As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.](https://quranwbw.com/7/170)

* __44/34__: [Indeed, these ˹Meccans˺ say,](https://quranwbw.com/44/34)
