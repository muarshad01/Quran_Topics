## Al Baqarah

* __2/40 (Fulfill M promise)__: [O children of Israel!1 Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your covenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me ˹alone˺.](https://quranwbw.com/2/40) 

* __2/47 (Remember My favours)__: [O Children of Israel! Remember ˹all˺ the favours I granted you and how I honoured you above the others.](https://quranwbw.com/2/47) 

***

* __2/49 (We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh)__: [˹Remember˺ how We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.](https://quranwbw.com/2/49) 

* __2/50 (We parted the sea, rescued you)__: [And ˹remember˺ when We parted the sea, rescued you, and drowned Pharaoh’s people before your very eyes.](https://quranwbw.com/2/50) 

* __2/51 (We appointed forty nights for Moses)__: [And ˹remember˺ when We appointed forty nights for Moses, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.](https://quranwbw.com/2/51) 

* __2/52__: [Even then We ˹still˺ forgave you so perhaps you would be grateful.](https://quranwbw.com/2/52) 

***

* __2/56__: []() Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks.

* __2/57__: []() And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you manna and quails: Eat of the good things that We have given you; and they did not do Us any harm, but they made their own souls suffer the loss.

* __2/58__: []() And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others).

* __2/59__: []() But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed.

* __2/61__: []() And when you said: O Musa! We cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they be- came deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.

* __2/63__: []() And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you: Take hold of the law (Taurat) We have given you with firm- ness and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).

* __2/64__: []() Then you turned back after that; so were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have been among the losers.

* __2/65__: []() And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.

* __2/66__: []() So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).

#### Cow
* __2/67 (a'oozu billaahi an akoona minal jaahileen)__: [And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.”1 They replied, “Are you mocking us?” Moses responded, “I seek refuge in Allah from acting foolishly!”](https://quranwbw.com/2/67)

* __2/68__: [They said, “Call upon your Lord to clarify for us what type ˹of cow˺ it should be!” He replied, “Allah says, ‘The cow should neither be old nor young but in between. So do as you are commanded!’”](https://quranwbw.com/2/68) 

* __2/69__: [They said, “Call upon your Lord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a bright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’”](https://quranwbw.com/2/69) 

* __2/70__: [Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/70) 

* __2/71__: [He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly!](https://quranwbw.com/2/71) 

* __2/72__: [˹This is˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah revealed what you concealed.
](https://quranwbw.com/2/72)

* __2/73__: [So We instructed, “Strike the dead body with a piece of the cow.” This is how ˹easily˺ Allah brings the dead to life, showing you His signs so that you may understand.
](https://quranwbw.com/2/73)
***

* __2/74__: []() Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were like rocks, rather worse in hardness; and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and surely there are some of them which split asunder so water issues out of them, and surely there are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.

* __2/75__: []() Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).

* __2/83__: []() And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: You shall not serve any but Allah and (you shall do) good to (your) parents, and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy, and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate. Then you turned back except a few of you and (now too) you turn aside.

* __2/84__: []() And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities; then you gave a promise while you witnessed.

* __2/85__: []() Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes, backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits; and if they should come to you, as captives you would ransom them, while their very turning out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other? What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement, and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.

* __2/92__: []() And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his absence and you were unjust.

* __2/93__: []() And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey. And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief Say: Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers.

* __2/94__: []() Say: If the future abode with Allah is especially for you to the exclusion of the people, then invoke death if you are truthful.

* __2/95__: []() And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before, and Allah knows the unjust.

* __2/96__: []() And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and Allah sees what they do.

* __2/111 (claim only Jews and Christins with enter Paradise)__: [The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/111)
  
* __2/122__: [O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others.](https://quranwbw.com/2/122)

* __2/211 (How many clear signs We have given them?)__: [Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. And whoever trades Allah’s favour—after receiving it—˹for disbelief˺ should know that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.](https://quranwbw.com/2/211)

* __2/243 (Die!!! Which Incident is this???)__: [Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who fled their homes in the thousands for fear of death? Allah said to them, “Die!” then He gave them life. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful.](https://quranwbw.com/2/243)

## Surah Aal-i-Imran

* __Surah 3/93 (They made food unlawful to them)__: [All food was lawful for the children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring the Torah and read it, if your claims are true.”](https://quranwbw.com/3/93)

* __Surah 3/94__: [Then whoever still fabricates lies about Allah, they will be the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.](https://quranwbw.com/3/94)

***

## Surah An-Nisaa

### Wanted to See Allah SWT
* __Surah 4/153 (Bring us in Writing from Allah SWT)__: [The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven. They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

* __Surah 4/154 (Raised Mountain )__: [We raised the Mount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said, “Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

* __Surah 4/155 (Kill the Prophets)__: [˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few—](https://quranwbw.com/4/154)

* __Surah 4/156__: [and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary,](https://quranwbw.com/4/155)

***

#### 12 Leaders
* __Surah 5/12__: [Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders from among them and ˹then˺ said, “I am truly with you. If you establish prayer, pay alms-tax, believe in My messengers, support them, and lend to Allah a good loan, I will certainly forgive your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow. And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”](https://quranwbw.com/5/12)

* __Surah 5/13 (Always find deceit on their part)__: [But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ˹O Prophet˺ will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.](https://quranwbw.com/5/13)

#### Killed Prophets
* __Surah 5/70__: [Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not desire, they denied some and killed others.](https://quranwbw.com/5/70)

* __Surah 5/71__: [They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.](https://quranwbw.com/5/71)

* __Surah 5/78 (The are Cursed)__: [The disbelievers among the Children of Israel were condemned in the revelations of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That was for their disobedience and violations.](https://quranwbw.com/5/78)

* __Surah 5/80 (They've earned Allah’s Wrath!)__: [You see many of them taking the disbelievers as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have earned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment.](https://quranwbw.com/5/80)

* __Surah 5/81 (They take Pagans as Allies)__: [Had they believed in Allah, the Prophet, and what has been revealed to him, they would have never taken those ˹pagans˺ as allies. But most of them are rebellious.](https://quranwbw.com/5/81)

***

## Al Araaf (The Heights)

* __7/163 (Sabbath)__: [Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.1 During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.](https://quranwbw.com/7/163)

* __7/164__: [When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”](https://quranwbw.com/7/164)

* __7/168__: [We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.
](https://quranwbw.com/7/168)

* __7/169__: [Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?
](https://quranwbw.com/7/169)
