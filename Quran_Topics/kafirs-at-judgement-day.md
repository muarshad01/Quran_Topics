#### __Surah Al-Ahqaf 46/35__: [يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا سَاعَةًۭ مِّن نَّهَارٍۭ ۚ](https://quranwbw.com/46/35)

#### Ransom
* __Surah Ar-Raad 13/18__: [Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest!](https://quran.com/13/18)

#### Wish
* __Surah Al-Hijr 15/2__: [رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ مُسْلِمِينَ][˹The day will come when˺ the disbelievers will certainly wish they had submitted ˹to Allah˺.](https://quran.com/15/2)
