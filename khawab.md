#### [Dream Signs You Must Know | SSA Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZjCe02IDFo)
* There are three types of dreams:
1. Sachay - Tabeer is exactly like what we saw the dream
2. We need Tabeer - Only that person who know Ilm-e-tabeer, can tell us the tabeer
3. Third type is based on our-Waswasa or our-Nafs-is-showing-us
* Never tell-your-dream after __2:00 pm__ in the afternoon. Otherwise, it is wasted!
* What is your spiritual-condition
* What part-of-night you've seen that dream
* Right after sleeping...digestion systems is active...
  * Last-1/3 part-of-night - Tahajjat; our own sooch / mind / thinking
  * Right Before / After the Fajr prayer
