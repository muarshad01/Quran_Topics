## Istigfar
* Istighfar, in Islam, is the act of seeking forgiveness from Allah (God). It's a common practice among Muslims, typically involving the recitation of `Astaghfirullah" (أَسْتَغْفِرُ ٱللَّٰهَ)`, which means "I seek forgiveness from Allah". It's a way to acknowledge one's sins and seek divine pardon
