* __2/111 (claim only Jews and Christins with enter Paradise)__: [The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.”](https://quranwbw.com/2/111)

Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

* __4/154 (Raised Mountain )__: [We raised the Mount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said, “Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant.](https://quranwbw.com/4/153)

And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”](https://quranwbw.com/5/12)

* __Surah 5/13 (Always find deceit on their part)__: [But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts.

* __7/164__: [When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”](https://quranwbw.com/7/164)

](https://quranwbw.com/7/168)

* __7/169__: [Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?
