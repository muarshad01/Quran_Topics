* Never tell-your-dream after __2:00 pm__ in the afternoon. Otherwise, it is wasted!!
* There are three types of dreams:
1. Sachay - Tabeer is exactly like what we saw the dream
2. We need Tabeer - Only that person who know Ilm-e-tabeer, can tell us the tabeer
3. Third type is based on our Waswasa-or-Nafs is-showing-us

* What is your Spiritual-condition

* What part-of-night you've seen that dream
   * Right after sleeping...digestion systems is active...
   * Last-1/3 part-of-night - Tahajjat; our own sooch / mind / thinking
