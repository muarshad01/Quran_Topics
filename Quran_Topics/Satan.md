They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter.

Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.](https://quranwbw.com/2/275)
