In the Quran, the word "Fawz" (فوز) and its derivations (like "Fawzan" and "Faaizoon") relate to success, triumph, and achievement, particularly in the context of the afterlife and attaining Paradise. The term signifies a state of ultimate victory and attainment of what is good and desirable, both in this world and the hereafter. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
"Fawz" (فوز) is a noun meaning success, triumph, or victory. 
"Fawzan" (فوزان) is a dual form, suggesting a double or complete success. 
"Faaizoon" (فآئزون) is a plural form, referring to those who have achieved success.
