* __Surah An-Nisaa 4/113 (وَكَانَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيمًۭا)__: [Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, a group of them would have sought to deceive you ˹O Prophet˺. Yet they would deceive none but themselves, nor can they harm you in the least. Allah has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and taught you what you never knew. Great ˹indeed˺ is Allah’s favour upon you!](https://quranwbw.com/4/113)
