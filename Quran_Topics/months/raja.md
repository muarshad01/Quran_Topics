1. __Rajab al-Murajjab (رَجَب المُرَجَّب)__: The highly honored and venerated month, derived from the word __Tarjeeb" (to honor)__.
2. __Rajab al-Asamm (رجب الأصمّ)__: The `silent or deaf month`, as warfare and fighting were forbidden.
3. __Rajab Al-Asab (رجب الأصب)__: The month of abundant mercy, as Allah showers blessings.
4. __Rajab Al-Fard (رجب الفرد)__: The solitary or separate Rajab, because it stands alone from the __other 3-consecutive sacred months (11-Dhu al-Hijjah, 12-Dhu al-Qi'dah, 1-Muharram).__
5. __Rajab al-Mudhar (رجب مضر)__: Named for the Mudhar tribe's (Bani Mudhar) special respect for it.
