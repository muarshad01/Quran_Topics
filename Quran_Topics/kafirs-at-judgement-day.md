* __Surah Al-Ahqaf 46/35 (Just an hour of Day)__: [يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوٓا۟ إِلَّا سَاعَةًۭ مِّن نَّهَارٍۭ ۚ][So endure patiently, as did the Messengers of Firm Resolve.1 And do not ˹seek to˺ hasten ˹the torment˺ for the deniers. On the Day they see what they have been threatened with, it will be as if they had only stayed ˹in this world˺ for an hour of a day.2 ˹This is˺ a ˹sufficient˺ warning! Then, will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people?](https://quranwbw.com/46/35)

* __Surah Ar-Raad 13/18 (Give Ranson)__: [لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًۭا وَمِثْلَهُۥ مَعَهُۥ لَٱفْتَدَوْا۟ بِهِۦٓ ۚ][Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest!](https://quran.com/13/18)

* __Surah Al-Hijr 15/2 (Kafir Wish)__: [رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْ كَانُوا۟ مُسْلِمِينَ][˹The day will come when˺ the disbelievers will certainly wish they had submitted ˹to Allah˺.](https://quran.com/15/2)
