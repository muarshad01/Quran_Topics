## [Surah Noor - Ayat 35](https://quran.com/24/35)
* Allah SWT is the `Light (Noor) of the Heavens and the Earth`
* Concentric Circles

#### `Misbaah` - Fanous (Lantern)
* Human `HEART` is like a `Fanous (Lantern)`
* If the glass of Lantern is foggy then the light will not be able to spread out and will remain trapped inside
* Once we clean / purify our heart (i.e. clean the Lantern glass) then the Lantern light, which fells upon it, refrects and spreads out in all directions
* Heart has 10 impurities (`Al-Ghazali [1058 – 1111]`)
    * Unless our heart is not PURIFIED (`Aina-e-Dil` is not purified), God doesn't live there

#### Zaitoon (Olive) Tree - Oil 
* `Ilm-aur-Imaan`
  * [..and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/34)
  * `Imaan` is ready to be ignited, `barhaknay ko tayar hai (yakaadu zaituhaa yudeee)`
      * He who adopts the `path of Naaki`, to aus kay dil main soay huay imaan ki changari barhak uthti hai 
      * Iman ki taraf Pehla qadam uthata hai (Zara si effort karta hai) to aus kay dil main iman panapnay lagta hai

#### La Shar-qe-ya-tin wa-la Ghar-bi-ya-tin (Not of the East and Not of the West)
* Since, `Imaan` has no `haad-o-hisab (limts)` thats why it has been mentioned that it is `Not of the East and Not of the West`

***

* Paki: Intellectual Paki and Maturity

## Prophet PBUH prayer
* `Ya Allah, Mujhay Qayammat Kay Din Masakeen Main Uthana`
* `al-masakeen`, which refers to the needy. 
  * The distinction between the two (poor, needy) lies in the fact that the `poor have nothing` at all, while the `needy have very little` to sustain themselves.
