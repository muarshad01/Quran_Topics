2. __Rajab al-Asamm (رجب الأصمّ)__: The `silent or deaf month`, as warfare and fighting were forbidden.
3. __Rajab Al-Asab (رجب الأصب)__: The month of abundant mercy, as Allah showers blessings.
4. __Rajab Al-Fard (رجب الفرد)__: The solitary or separate Rajab, because it stands alone from the __other 3-consecutive sacred months (11-Dhu al-Hijjah, 12-Dhu al-Qi'dah, 1-Muharram).__

#### [Rewards of Rajab Fasting! | رجب کے روزوں کی فضیلت | SSA Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhAdemUONeM)
* 15 = 7+8 Fasts
* 1 Fast: 30 years of Fasting reward
* 1 Fast: One door of Hell is closed. Since [Hell has 7 doors](https://quran.com/15/43-44), If you keep 7 fasts ALL seven doors are closed.
* 1 Fast: Open a door of Jannah. Therefore, keeping 8 fasts...opens up ALL 8 doors of Jannah.

The Prophet ﷺ informed us that Jannah has eight gates, each for a special group of believers.
1. Baab As-Salaah (Prayer Gate)
2. Baab Al-Jihad
3. Baab As-Sadaqah
4. Baab Ar-Rayyān
