* Things will settle down in another year or so...things will be smooth afterwards

#### Problem versus Symptons-of-Problem
1. Find out the actual problem
2. We should establish the root-cause of that problem
3. To fix the responsiblity
4. We try to find out remedies
5. Take preventive measures

#### Islam gives concept of "Muslim Ummah" (Root Cause!)
* No Pakistan, No Qatari, ALL Muslims
* We became Slaves of our own interests
* Muslims have abundant wealth
* Deposited that wealth with enemies

#### Leader who can Unite Muslims
* President Ayub Khan of Pakistan was a key figure in the formation of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD)
* Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, was a prominent advocate for greater unity among Muslim nations.
* Solution: __Muslim UNO__

#### Pakistan
1. Came into being on Shab-e-Qadr
2. Single handedly one man made it
3. Its founder never went to jail even for a second
4. Not even a single drop of blood is shed
5. 1400 mile border meets with a Kafir country
6. Got a dispute from its first day: Assets, Water, ...
* We established the largest Ordinance Factory
* We established most well trained Muslim Army
* Our mistake: We broke Allah Order; Munkir-Khuda versus Mushrik-Khuda
* We broker the Super-Power
* Success has many fathers whereas failure has none
* __Just wait for one and half year...Pakistan will go up like a Rocket...InShaa Allah!__
* __People will come here from Europe to find Jobs in Pakistan.__
* We'll be issuing work permit.
