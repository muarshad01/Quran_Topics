#### Allah SWT Noor
* __Surah 24/35__: [۞ ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ۚ مَثَلُ نُورِهِۦ كَمِشْكَوٰةٍۢ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ۖ ٱلْمِصْبَاحُ فِى زُجَاجَةٍ ۖ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌۭ دُرِّىٌّۭ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍۢ مُّبَـٰرَكَةٍۢ زَيْتُونَةٍۢ لَّا شَرْقِيَّةٍۢ وَلَا غَرْبِيَّةٍۢ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِىٓءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌۭ ۚ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍۢ ۗ يَهْدِى ٱللَّهُ لِنُورِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْأَمْثَـٰلَ لِلنَّاسِ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۭ](https://quran.com/24/35)

#### Misbaah - Fanous (Lantern)
* Human `HEART` is like a `Fanous (Lantern)`
* If the glass-of-Lantern is foggy then the-light-will-not-be-able-to-spread-out and will remain trapped-inside
* Once we clean / purify our heart (i.e. clean the Lantern glass) then the Lantern light, which fells upon it, refrects and spreads out in all directions
* Heart has 10 impurities (Al-Ghazali [1058 – 1111])
   * Unless our heart is not PURIFIED (`Aina-e-Dil` is not purified), God doesn't live there.

#### [The Olive Tree (Oil) in Surah Noor | SSA Shah](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KQq1DEkEf3g)
* Ilm-aur-Imaan
   * [..and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/34)
   * `Imaan` is ready to be ignited, `bar-kha-nay ko tayar-hai (يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِىٓءُ)`
      * He who adopts the `path-of-Naaki`, to aus-kay dil-mayn soay-huay imaan-ki-changari barhak-uthti-hai 
      * Imaan-ki-taraf pehla-qadam uthata-hai (Zara-si-effort karta-hai) to aus-kay dil-mayn iman-panapnay lagta-hai

#### La Shar-qe-ya-tin wa-la Ghar-bi-ya-tin (لَّا شَرْقِيَّةٍۢ وَلَا غَرْبِيَّةٍۢ)
* Since, `Imaan` has no `haad-o-hisab (limts)` thats why it has been mentioned that it is `Not-of-the-East and Not-of-the-West`

    * I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes.
