He has also provided you with clothes protecting you from the heat ˹and cold˺, and armour shielding you in battle. This is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺. (82) But if they turn away, then your duty ˹O Prophet˺ is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.
