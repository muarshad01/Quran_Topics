## Satan Makes You Forget

* __Surah An-Nisa 4/140__: [He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them.1 Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.](https://quran.com/4/140)

* __Surah Al-Anam 6/68__: [And when you come across those who ridicule Our revelations, do not sit with them unless they engage in a different topic. Should Satan make you forget, then once you remember, do not ˹continue to˺ sit with the wrongdoing people.](https://quran.com/6/68)
