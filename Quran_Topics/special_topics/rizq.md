No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.](https://quran.com/2/233)

* __Surah Al-Baqarah 2/254__: [O believers! Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining,1 friendship,2 or intercession. Those who disbelieve are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.
